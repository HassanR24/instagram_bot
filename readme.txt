The purpose of the Bot was to login to Instagram, type a user-provided keyword in search bar,
open the first account in search results, open the followers of that account and then
finally follow each of the accounts in following lists. I created the whole automation script using Selenium.
The bot was created with user's personal chrome profile, undetected chrome driver and random 
time intervals between each step to avoid bot detection by Instagram.
